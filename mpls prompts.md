Here are some example prompts you can use with ChatGPT to generate optimal, secure configurations for different types of routers in an MPLS network, such as Provider (P), Provider Edge (PE), and Customer Edge (CE) routers:

### Provider (P) Router Configuration
1. **Basic P Router Configuration:**
   - "Generate a baseline Cisco IOS configuration for a Provider (P) router in an MPLS network, including basic security settings and interface configurations."
  
2. **Secure P Router with OSPF and AAA:**
   - "Provide a secure configuration for a P router in an MPLS network, including OSPF routing with MD5 authentication, AAA authentication for VTY access, and SSH for remote management."

3. **P Router with BGP and MPLS:**
   - "Create a configuration for a P router that includes BGP for MPLS VPNs, OSPF for IGP, and MPLS LDP. Ensure security best practices are applied."

### Provider Edge (PE) Router Configuration
4. **Basic PE Router Configuration:**
   - "Generate a baseline configuration for a Provider Edge (PE) router, including MPLS VPN setup, basic security features, and interface configurations."

5. **Secure PE Router with VRF and OSPF:**
   - "Provide a secure configuration for a PE router in an MPLS network, including VRF instances, OSPF routing with MD5 authentication, AAA for VTY access, and SSH for remote management."

6. **PE Router with BGP and Route Reflector:**
   - "Create a configuration for a PE router that uses BGP with route reflectors for MPLS VPNs. Include security best practices and interface configurations."

### Customer Edge (CE) Router Configuration
7. **Basic CE Router Configuration:**
   - "Generate a baseline configuration for a Customer Edge (CE) router connected to a PE router, including basic security features and interface configurations."

8. **Secure CE Router with OSPF and BGP:**
   - "Provide a secure configuration for a CE router in an MPLS network, including OSPF for IGP, BGP for external routing, AAA for VTY access, and SSH for remote management."

9. **CE Router with Static Routing and VPN:**
   - "Create a configuration for a CE router that uses static routing to connect to a PE router and includes IPsec VPN for secure communication. Apply security best practices."

### General Security and Optimization Prompts
10. **Best Practices for Router Security:**
    - "List best practices for securing a Cisco IOS router in an MPLS network, including recommendations for access control, encryption, and management protocols."

11. **Optimizing Router Performance:**
    - "Provide tips for optimizing the performance of Cisco routers in an MPLS network, including interface tuning, routing protocol optimization, and MPLS settings."

12. **Comprehensive Security for Network Devices:**
    - "Generate a comprehensive security configuration for network devices in an MPLS network, covering aspects like AAA, SNMP security, logging, and interface protection."

These prompts will help you get detailed, specific configurations and security best practices for different types of routers in an MPLS network. Adjust the details in the prompts based on your specific requirements and network topology.
